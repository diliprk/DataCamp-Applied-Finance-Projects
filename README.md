# DataCamp - Applied Finance Projects
This repository is a collection of the following guided projects I completed on datacamp.com, focused on data science in the Applied Finance sector.

## 1.) [Which Debts Are Worth the Bank's Effort?](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/504)
After a debt has been legally declared "uncollectable" by a bank, the account is considered to be "charged-off." But that doesn't mean the bank simply walks away from the debt. They still want to collect some of the money they are owed. In this project, I used regression discontinuity , an intuitive and useful analysis method in any situation of threshold assignment and other statistical methods  to assess a situation where a bank assigned delinquent customers to  different debt recovery strategies based on the expected amount the bank believed it would recover from the customer.


## 2.)  [Predicting Credit Card Approvals](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/558)
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low-income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, I built an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do. <br> The dataset (located inside the folder called `datasets`) used in this project is the  [Credit Card Approval dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval)  from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
